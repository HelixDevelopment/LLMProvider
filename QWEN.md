## INHERITED FROM constitution/QWEN.md

All rules in `constitution/QWEN.md` (and the `constitution/Constitution.md`
it references) apply unconditionally. This module's rules below extend them —
they do NOT weaken any universal clause. When this file disagrees with the
constitution submodule, the constitution wins. Locate the constitution
submodule from any arbitrary nested depth using its `find_constitution.sh`
helper.

The universal anti-bluff covenant (§11.4), no-guessing mandate (§11.4.6),
credentials-handling mandate (§11.4.10), host-session safety (§12 + §12.6 +
§12.10), and data safety (§9) all live in `constitution/Constitution.md`.
Read it before working on any non-trivial change.

## How this file relates to CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md

Per §11.4.35 canonical-root inheritance clarity:

- `constitution/QWEN.md` is the universal canonical root for the Qwen Code CLI.
- This file is the consumer-side extension for this submodule, carrying only
  the inheritance pointer + the §11.4 covenant anchors + a brief module summary.
- The full module ruleset lives in this submodule's sibling `CLAUDE.md`.
  Qwen Code agents MUST read CLAUDE.md before performing any work; this
  QWEN.md is the Qwen-specific entry point that ensures Qwen reads the
  inheritance pointer + anti-bluff covenant on every session.

## Module summary

LLM provider abstraction layer for HelixQA. Wraps OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and local-model backends behind a uniform API consumed by LLMOrchestrator.

For full module context (build steps, integration points, host-session safety,
submodule-specific commit/push discipline) read this directory's `CLAUDE.md`
and `AGENTS.md`.

## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF COVENANT — END-USER QUALITY GUARANTEE (User mandate, 2026-04-28)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all
> Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work
> and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and
> Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability
> by end users of the product!"

This is the historical origin of the project's anti-bluff covenant. Every
test, every Challenge, every gate, every mutation pair exists to make the
failure mode (PASS on broken-for-end-user feature) mechanically impossible.

**Operative rule:** the bar for shipping is **not** "tests pass" but
**"users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry
positive evidence captured during execution that the feature works for the
end user. Metadata-only PASS, configuration-only PASS, "absence-of-error"
PASS, and grep-based PASS without runtime evidence are all critical defects
regardless of how green the summary line looks.

**Tests AND Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally** — a Challenge that
scores PASS on a non-functional feature is the same class of defect as a
unit test that does. Both must produce positive end-user evidence; both
are subject to the §8.1 five-constraint rule and §11 captured-evidence
requirement.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule
[`Constitution.md`](../../../../constitution/Constitution.md) §11.4 (this
end-user-quality-guarantee forensic anchor — propagation requirement
enforced by pre-build gate `CM-COVENANT-114-QWEN-PROPAGATION`).

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

## §11.4 extension anchors carried by this file

The following extension anchors apply unconditionally to every change
landed in this submodule. Their full text lives in the sibling CLAUDE.md
and in the canonical `constitution/Constitution.md`. Listed here so Qwen
Code agents can locate them by literal string match:

- **§11.4.1 extension (Phase 33, 2026-05-05)** — FAIL-bluffs equally
  forbidden. A test that crashes for a script-internal reason and produces
  a FAIL exit code is just as misleading as a PASS-bluff. Fix at source
  layer, never at call sites.
- **§11.4.2 extension (Phase 34, 2026-05-06)** — Recorded-evidence
  requirement. Every PASS for a user-visible feature MUST be cross-checked
  by the analyzer against the dual-display recording + action timeline.
- **§11.4.3 extension (Phase 34, 2026-05-06)** — Per-device-topology test
  dispatch. Topology-touching tests MUST detect topology at entry and
  dispatch the topology-appropriate variant.
- **§11.4.4 extension (User mandate, 2026-05-06)** —
  Test-interrupt-on-discovery + retest-from-clean-baseline. The moment any
  defect is re-discovered or newly identified mid-cycle, STOP and fix at
  root cause + four-layer coverage + full rebuild + reflash + retest.
- **§11.4.4 expansion (User mandate, 2026-05-06)** — Systematic debugging
  via superpowers skills + four-layer test coverage per fix (pre-build
  gate + post-build gate + post-flash on-device test + HelixQA Challenge +
  paired mutation) + documentation update + no-bluff certification per
  cycle.
- **§11.4.5 — Audio + video quality analysis comprehensiveness (User mandate, 2026-05-07)** —
  Audio: presence + channel count + sample rate + glitch census +
  coexistence-artifact census. Video: presence + routing target + frame
  health + obstruction census + resolution + codec. Challenges bound equally.
- **§11.4.6 — No-guessing mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-08)** —
  Forbidden vocabulary: `likely`, `probably`, `maybe`, `might`,
  `possibly`, `presumably`, `seems`, `appears to`. Prove with
  captured evidence OR mark `UNCONFIRMED:` / `UNKNOWN:` /
  `PENDING_FORENSICS:`.
- **§11.4.7 — Demotion-evidence rule (Phase 38.X+2 amendment, 2026-05-11)** —
  Demotion from FAIL to lower-severity requires positive evidence captured
  under the same conditions that originally exposed the defect.
- **§11.4.8 — Deep-web-research-before-implementation mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)** —
  Cite external source URL OR literal "NO external solution found — original
  work" in every non-trivial fix.
- **§11.4.9 — Batch-source-fixes-before-rebuild mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)** —
  All source-side fixes that DO NOT require runtime on-device validation
  MUST be landed BEFORE the next firmware rebuild.
- **§11.4.10 — Credentials-handling mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)** —
  Credentials NEVER live in tracked files. `.env` git-ignored project-wide.
  Tests load from `scripts/testing/secrets/` (chmod 600).
- **§11.4.13 — Out-of-band sink-side captured-evidence mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-13)** —
  When an HDMI sink with network-accessible introspection API is present,
  every audio test MUST consume the sink's report as captured-evidence.
- **§11.4.14 — Test playback cleanup mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-13)** —
  Every test that issues `am start` / `cmd media_session play` MUST
  issue matching `am force-stop` / `KEYCODE_MEDIA_STOP` + EXIT trap.
- **§11.4.15 — Item-status tracking mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-13)** —
  Every active item in `Issues.md` carries a `**Status:**` line.
- **§11.4.16 — Item-type tracking mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-14)** —
  Every active item in `Issues.md` carries a `**Type:**` line with one
  of `{Bug | Feature | Task}`.
- **§11.4.40 — Full-suite retest before release tag mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-17)** —
  Release tag MUST NOT be created until a complete retest with ALL existing
  tests has been executed on a clean baseline.
- **§11.4.41 — Pre-Force-Push Merge-First Mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-17)** —
  Every force-push MUST be preceded by a mechanical 4-step merge-first
  pipeline (fetch + integrate + audit + push with `--force-with-lease`).

## MANDATORY §12.6 MEMORY-BUDGET CEILING — 60% MAXIMUM (User mandate, 2026-04-30)

Project procedures MUST NOT use more than **60% of total system RAM**
(`HOST_SAFETY_MAX_MEM_PCT`). The remaining 40% is reserved for the
operator's other workloads. There is NO operator-facing override flag.

`scripts/build.sh` wraps `m -j` in `bounded_run` so only the
bounded scope is OOM-killed if the build's collective RSS exceeds the
budget — `user@<uid>.service` stays alive.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule
[`Constitution.md`](../../../../constitution/Constitution.md) §12.6.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.
